            <p>My name is Ahmed Alhamwi, a 19-year-old first-year ICT Software Development student at ROC Mondriaan. I started this program in 2024 in class B1J. Previously, I completed my MAVO diploma in 2022 and continued with HAVO-level coursework, including computer science. From a young age, I've been fascinated by how computer programs work, which naturally led me to pursue a career in software development. I am passionate about building innovative software solutions and designing user-friendly interfaces that make a real impact.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">My Strengths</h2>
            <p>I am a creative and independent thinker who values reliability, dedication, and perseverance. I don’t give up easily, and I thrive in team environments where collaboration and communication are essential. I approach tasks with focus and structure, and I’m highly adaptable, learning quickly—especially when it comes to logical problem-solving. I believe in continuous improvement through constructive feedback, both giving and receiving, to grow together with those I work with.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Experience</h2>
            <p>Throughout my studies in ICT, I’ve worked on multiple programming projects and learned new languages along the way. During my time in HAVO, I studied computer science, where I created projects like a hangman game using JavaScript in the console. At the MBO level, I’ve built projects including a web application for managing personal finances and an interactive browser-based game. Each project has helped me improve both my technical and problem-solving skills.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Technical Skills</h2>
            <p>I am proficient in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, which I use to structure and style my web projects. I also work with <strong>JavaScript</strong> to build interactive and dynamic user experiences, and have already completed several projects using this language. Currently, I’m expanding my front-end development knowledge by learning how to use the <strong>Bootstrap</strong> framework to build responsive, mobile-friendly layouts efficiently.</p>
            <p>In addition, I am advancing my skills in <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> as part of a new full-stack project I'm developing, where I aim to integrate dynamic server-side logic with database management. I’m also diving into game development, learning <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> to create interactive and engaging games.</p>
            <p>My goal is to continue broadening my expertise by learning modern frameworks such as <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong>, and to keep improving my back-end development skills. I am committed to lifelong learning and constantly seek opportunities to grow as a developer.</p>

            <p>Outside of IT, I also have valuable work experience in the retail sector. I worked for a year at Albert Heijn and have been employed at Lidl for over 2.5 years.

I’ve also learned how to handle workplace challenges and take initiative in supporting and guiding colleagues.</p>
