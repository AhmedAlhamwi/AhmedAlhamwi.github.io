            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Welcome to My Portfolio Website!</h2>
            <p>My name is Ahmed Alhamwi, a 19-year-old first-year ICT Software Development student at ROC Mondriaan. I started this program in 2024 in class B1J. Previously, I completed my MAVO diploma in 2022 and continued with HAVO-level coursework, including computer science. From a young age, I've been fascinated by how computer programs work, which naturally led me to pursue a career in software development. I am passionate about building innovative software solutions and designing user-friendly interfaces that make a real impact.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">My Strengths</h2>
            <p>I am a creative and independent thinker who values reliability, dedication, and perseverance. I don’t give up easily, and I thrive in team environments where collaboration and communication are essential. I approach tasks with focus and structure, and I’m highly adaptable, learning quickly—especially when it comes to logical problem-solving. I believe in continuous improvement through constructive feedback, both giving and receiving, to grow together with those I work with.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Experience</h2>
            <p>Throughout my studies in ICT, I’ve worked on multiple programming projects and learned new languages along the way. During my time in HAVO, I studied computer science, where I created projects like a hangman game using JavaScript in the console. At the MBO level, I’ve built projects including a web application for managing personal finances and an interactive browser-based game. Each project has helped me improve both my technical and problem-solving skills.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Technical Skills</h2>
            <p>I am proficient in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, which I use to structure and style my web projects. I also work with <strong>JavaScript</strong> to build interactive and dynamic user experiences, and have already completed several projects using this language. Currently, I’m expanding my front-end development knowledge by learning how to use the <strong>Bootstrap</strong> framework to build responsive, mobile-friendly layouts efficiently.</p>
            <p>In addition, I am advancing my skills in <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> as part of a new full-stack project I'm developing, where I aim to integrate dynamic server-side logic with database management. I’m also diving into game development, learning <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> to create interactive and engaging games.</p>
            <p>My goal is to continue broadening my expertise by learning modern frameworks such as <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong>, and to keep improving my back-end development skills. I am committed to lifelong learning and constantly seek opportunities to grow as a developer.</p>

            <h3>Project 1: Higher-Lower Game</h3>
            <p>My first project was creating a Higher-Lower Game. The objective was to develop a game where the player could play individually or against the computer. The game needed a proper layout using HTML and CSS, and the functionality was made with JavaScript, a credit system for betting, and buttons for wagering and guessing. I chose to make it a single-player experience. The game is structured so that the player can restart once their credit reaches -2600, and they win when they accumulate 3600 credits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project mb-4">
            <h3>Project 2: Build a New Game</h3>
            <p>The second project, "Build a New Game", involved creating a game island where the player could navigate to three different games of their choice. I was responsible for designing the main page layout and developing a chess game. My chess game includes a 1v1 mode and a 1vComputer mode, where the difficulty level can be adjusted. My teammates each worked on different games: one developed Tic-Tac-Toe, while another created Battleship. In this project, I had to create it with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

        <div class="project mb-4">
            <h3>Project 3: Review Your Experience – Pro Gamers</h3>
            <p>This project is part of my assignment at ROC Mondriaan, where I created a web application that lets users read and write reviews about gaming products. The app is user-friendly for both regular users and administrators. Key features include browsing categories, viewing product details, and submitting reviews.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies & Tools Used:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML5 & CSS3 – For building the layout and ensuring it looks good on all devices.</li>
                <li>Bootstrap – For styling and making the site mobile-friendly.</li>
                <li>PHP – For handling server-side tasks and managing data.</li>
                <li>MySQL – To store information about users, products, and reviews.</li>
                <li>JavaScript (planned) – To add interactive features like buttons and form validation.</li>
                <li>PDO (PHP Data Objects) – For secure communication with the database.</li>
                <li>XAMPP – For local development and testing.</li>
                <li>Git & GitHub – For tracking changes and collaborating with others.</li>
                <li>SCRUM – A method I used to manage the project in stages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>My Contributions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set up the project environment and connected PHP to the MySQL database.</li>
                <li>Created a homepage that shows product categories.</li>
                <li>Implemented user roles: administrators can manage content, while regular users can only view.</li>
                <li>Managed user sessions to keep track of logins.</li>
                <li>Followed SCRUM practices for effective project management.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project is still in development. I am currently working on features for user login, submitting reviews, and an admin panel.</p>

            <h3>Project 4: Fighting Game in Unity</h3>
            <p>For my fourth project, I am creating a fighting game in Unity as part of my Game Developer course. This project involves using techniques such as animation, character creation, story writing, and programming with C# to build an engaging and interactive game experience.</p>

            <h3>Project 5: Portfolio Website (Current Version)</h3>
            <p>This is the current version of my portfolio website, which I am actively developing to showcase my skills and projects. The website is built using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and the <strong>Bootstrap</strong> framework to create a responsive and visually appealing design. I am integrating modern web development techniques to ensure the site is mobile-friendly and user-centric.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this portfolio is to provide a comprehensive overview of my abilities as a software developer, including front-end and back-end skills, as well as my ongoing learning journey.</p>

            </div>
            <p><strong>Old Version of Portfolio:</strong></p>
            <p>The previous version of my portfolio was a simpler static website primarily built with basic <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. It served as an initial platform to present my work and skills but lacked the responsive design and interactivity of the current version.</p>
            <p>This update reflects my growth as a developer and my commitment to improving the user experience and design quality of my portfolio.</p>
